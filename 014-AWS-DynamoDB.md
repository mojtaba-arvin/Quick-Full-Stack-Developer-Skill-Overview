### AWS DynamoDB Basics:
- **NoSQL Database:** Understand the fundamentals of DynamoDB as a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS for storing and retrieving semi-structured data.
- **Key-Value Store:** Store data in DynamoDB tables using a key-value pair model with flexible schema and automatic scaling to handle variable workloads.
- **Partitions and Replicas:** DynamoDB partitions data across multiple physical storage nodes for scalability and replicates data across multiple availability zones for high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Primary Keys:** Define primary keys for DynamoDB tables using partition keys and optional sort keys for data partitioning, indexing, and query optimization.
- **Streams:** Enable DynamoDB Streams for capturing changes to table data in real-time and triggering event-driven workflows, data synchronization, and stream processing.

### Data Modeling and Schema Design:
- **Partitioning Strategy:** Design partition keys to evenly distribute data across partitions and avoid hot partitions for optimal performance and scalability.
- **Composite Keys:** Use composite keys (partition key and sort key) for hierarchical data organization and range-based querying in DynamoDB tables.
- **Attribute Types:** Choose appropriate data types for DynamoDB attributes (e.g., string, number, binary, set, map, list) based on data characteristics, access patterns, and query requirements.
- **Secondary Indexes:** Create secondary indexes (e.g., global secondary indexes, local secondary indexes) to support additional query patterns and enable efficient data retrieval by alternate attributes.

### Querying and Indexing:
- **Primary Key Queries:** Perform key-based retrieval operations (GetItem, PutItem, DeleteItem) on DynamoDB tables using primary key attributes for fast and efficient data access.
- **Query and Scan Operations:** Execute query and scan operations on DynamoDB tables using primary keys, secondary indexes, filter expressions, and projection expressions for data retrieval and filtering.
- **Sparse Indexes:** Design sparse indexes and composite keys in DynamoDB to support sparse data patterns, sparse attribute indexing, and efficient query execution with minimal index overhead.
- **Global Secondary Indexes (GSI):** Create global secondary indexes on DynamoDB tables to support non-primary key query patterns, alternate access paths, and ad-hoc queries across multiple attributes.

### Data Consistency and Transactions:
- **Eventual Consistency:** Understand DynamoDB's default eventual consistency model for read operations, which ensures that data modifications are eventually propagated to all replicas.
- **Strong Consistency:** Enable strong consistency for read operations on DynamoDB tables to ensure that read operations return the most up-to-date data and reflect recent changes made by write operations.
- **Transactions:** Use DynamoDB transactions to perform atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID) operations across multiple items, tables, or partitions in a single transactional request.

### Performance Optimization:
- **Partition Key Selection:** Choose efficient partition keys for DynamoDB tables based on workload patterns, access frequency, data distribution, and scalability requirements for optimal partitioning and load balancing.
- **Read and Write Capacity:** Provision read and write capacity units (RCUs and WCUs) for DynamoDB tables based on expected read and write throughput, peak usage patterns, and burst capacity requirements.
- **DAX Acceleration:** Accelerate read performance for DynamoDB tables using Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX), an in-memory caching service that provides low-latency access to cached data.
- **Auto Scaling:** Enable DynamoDB auto scaling to automatically adjust read and write capacity based on workload demand, traffic patterns, and application requirements without manual intervention.

### Backup and Restore:
- **Point-in-Time Recovery:** Enable point-in-time recovery (PITR) for DynamoDB tables to create continuous backups and restore table data to any point in time within the backup retention period for data protection and disaster recovery.
- **On-Demand Backups:** Create on-demand backups of DynamoDB tables using AWS Backup or the CreateBackup API operation for ad-hoc backups, data archival, and compliance requirements.
- **Data Export:** Export table data from DynamoDB to Amazon S3 using Data Pipeline, AWS Glue, or the ExportTableToPointInTime API operation for data migration, analytics, and archival purposes.

### Security and Access Control:
- **IAM Authentication:** Secure access to DynamoDB tables using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication, policies, and role-based access controls (RBAC) for fine-grained access control and least privilege principle.
- **Encryption at Rest:** Enable encryption at rest for DynamoDB tables using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) encryption keys to encrypt table data, backups, and snapshots for data confidentiality and compliance.
- **Encryption in Transit:** Encrypt data in transit between client applications and DynamoDB tables using Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for secure communication, data integrity, and protection against network eavesdropping.

### Monitoring and Performance Insights:
- **CloudWatch Metrics:** Monitor DynamoDB table performance metrics, throughput, latency, and resource utilization using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, alarms, and dashboards for real-time monitoring and alerting.
- **AWS X-Ray Tracing:** Trace and analyze requests to DynamoDB tables using AWS X-Ray distributed tracing for end-to-end visibility into application performance, latency, and dependencies for troubleshooting and optimization.
- **Performance Insights:** Enable DynamoDB Performance Insights to visualize and analyze database performance, query execution plans, and resource utilization for identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing query performance.

### Integration with AWS Services:
- **AWS Lambda Triggers:** Integrate DynamoDB tables with AWS Lambda functions using DynamoDB Streams for triggering serverless functions, event-driven workflows, and real-time data processing in response to table changes.
- **Amazon S3 Integration:** Integrate DynamoDB with Amazon S3 using AWS Glue or Data Pipeline for data lake integration, data archival, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, and analytics use cases.
- **Amazon Redshift Integration:** Load data from DynamoDB tables into Amazon Redshift using AWS Glue or Data Pipeline for data warehousing, analytics, and business intelligence (BI) applications.
