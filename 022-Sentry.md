### Sentry Basics:
- **Error Monitoring:** Understand the fundamentals of Sentry as an error monitoring and reporting platform used for tracking and managing application errors, exceptions, and crashes.
- **Exception Tracking:** Integrate Sentry with applications, frameworks, and platforms to capture and report exceptions, errors, and stack traces in real-time for debugging, troubleshooting, and incident response.
- **Issue Management:** Organize and manage error reports, incidents, and issues in Sentry's web interface, including grouping similar errors, assigning ownership, setting status, and adding comments for collaboration and resolution.

### Error Reporting and Alerting:
- **Automatic Error Reporting:** Automatically capture and report errors, exceptions, and crashes from applications, services, and environments using Sentry SDKs, integrations, and plugins for proactive error monitoring and alerting.
- **Alerting Rules:** Define alerting rules and thresholds in Sentry to trigger notifications, emails, or integrations (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty) based on error severity, frequency, or specific error patterns for timely incident response and resolution.

### Error Context and Metadata:
- **Error Context:** Attach contextual information, metadata, and tags to error reports and exceptions in Sentry to provide additional context, insights, and debugging clues for diagnosing and resolving issues.
- **User Feedback:** Collect user feedback, comments, and error reports directly from applications and end-users using Sentry's user feedback feature for capturing user-reported issues and enhancing error visibility.

### Error Aggregation and Grouping:
- **Error Grouping:** Group similar errors and exceptions together in Sentry using intelligent error grouping algorithms and heuristics to aggregate related error instances and reduce noise for effective error triage and resolution.
- **Fingerprinting:** Customize error grouping and aggregation in Sentry by specifying custom fingerprints, patterns, or attributes to control how errors are grouped and classified based on unique identifiers or error attributes.

### Release Tracking and Deployment Tracking:
- **Release Management:** Track application releases, deployments, and versions in Sentry to correlate errors, exceptions, and performance issues with specific code changes, releases, and deployments for regression testing and impact analysis.
- **Deployment Tracking:** Integrate Sentry with deployment automation tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI) to automatically record and track deployments, commits, and changesets associated with error occurrences and incidents.

### Performance Monitoring and Transaction Tracing:
- **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor application performance metrics, response times, and latency in Sentry using performance monitoring features and integrations for identifying performance bottlenecks, slow transactions, and resource constraints.
- **Transaction Tracing:** Trace and profile individual transactions, requests, and operations in distributed systems using Sentry's transaction tracing capabilities to visualize transaction flows, identify dependencies, and analyze performance hotspots.

### Customization and Extensibility:
- **Custom Integrations:** Extend Sentry's functionality and integration capabilities by building custom integrations, plugins, or extensions using Sentry's API, SDKs, webhooks, and plugin architecture for integrating with third-party tools, services, and platforms.
- **Webhooks and Callbacks:** Configure webhooks and callbacks in Sentry to trigger external actions, workflows, or automation tasks in response to specific events, alerts, or error conditions detected in the application.

### Compliance and Security:
- **Data Privacy:** Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations and standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) by configuring data retention policies, access controls, and encryption settings in Sentry to protect sensitive error data and logs.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure access to Sentry projects, organizations, and error data by enforcing authentication mechanisms, role-based access controls (RBAC), and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user authentication and authorization.

### Incident Management and Collaboration:
- **Incident Response:** Facilitate incident response and collaboration in Sentry by creating incident management workflows, timelines, and status updates for coordinating response efforts, communication, and resolution of critical issues.
- **Team Collaboration:** Enable team collaboration and communication in Sentry by sharing error reports, insights, and findings with team members, stakeholders, and subject matter experts using comments, mentions, and notifications.

### Performance Optimization and Error Reduction:
- **Error Analysis:** Analyze error trends, patterns, and root causes in Sentry to identify recurring errors, common failure modes, and areas for improvement in application code, architecture, and infrastructure.
- **Error Reduction Strategies:** Implement error reduction strategies and best practices based on insights and recommendations from Sentry's error analysis tools, reports, and performance monitoring data to minimize error rates, improve reliability, and enhance user experience.
