### MongoDB Basics:
- **NoSQL Database:** Understand the fundamentals of MongoDB as a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
- **Document Model:** Learn about MongoDB's document model for representing data as collections of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas and nested structures.
- **Collections and Documents:** Create and manage collections of documents in MongoDB for storing and retrieving data with support for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- **Indexes:** Improve query performance by creating indexes on document fields in MongoDB for efficient data retrieval and sorting.

### Data Modeling and Schema Design:
- **Schemaless Design:** Embrace MongoDB's flexible schema design for dynamic, schema-less data modeling without predefined structure or schema constraints.
- **Embedded Documents:** Use embedded documents and arrays to represent hierarchical relationships and nested data structures within MongoDB documents.
- **Normalization vs. Denormalization:** Balance between normalization and denormalization strategies in MongoDB data modeling for optimizing query performance and data consistency.
- **Reference vs. Embedding:** Choose between referencing related data with ObjectId references or embedding related data within documents for managing one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.

### Querying and Aggregation:
- **Query Language:** Use MongoDB Query Language (MQL) for executing queries against MongoDB collections with support for querying by field values, comparisons, logical operators, and regular expressions.
- **CRUD Operations:** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on MongoDB documents using MongoDB shell commands or MongoDB drivers and APIs in programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or Java.
- **Aggregation Pipeline:** Aggregate and transform data with MongoDB's Aggregation Pipeline framework for executing multi-stage data processing operations (e.g., filtering, grouping, projecting, sorting) on collections.

### Indexing and Query Optimization:
- **Index Types:** Create various types of indexes in MongoDB (e.g., single-field indexes, compound indexes, multi-key indexes, text indexes, geospatial indexes) for optimizing query performance and supporting different query patterns.
- **Explain Plan:** Analyze query execution plans using MongoDB's explain() method to understand query performance, index usage, and execution statistics for query optimization.
- **Index Strategies:** Apply indexing strategies such as index intersection, covered queries, and query hinting to improve query performance and minimize index overhead in MongoDB deployments.

### Replication and High Availability:
- **Replica Sets:** Deploy MongoDB replica sets for high availability and fault tolerance by maintaining multiple copies of data across replica set members and automatic failover in case of primary node failures.
- **Oplog:** Understand MongoDB's oplog (operation log) for tracking and replicating write operations across replica set members to maintain data consistency and synchronization.
- **Read Preference:** Configure read preferences in MongoDB applications to control how read operations are distributed among replica set members (e.g., primary, secondary, nearest) for load balancing and fault tolerance.

### Sharding and Scalability:
- **Sharded Clusters:** Scale out MongoDB deployments horizontally by partitioning data across multiple sharded clusters based on shard keys for distributing data storage and query load.
- **Shard Keys:** Choose appropriate shard keys for MongoDB sharding based on query patterns, data distribution, and scalability requirements to evenly distribute data and query load across shards.
- **Balancing:** Monitor and manage shard distribution and data balancing in MongoDB sharded clusters using balancer processes, chunk migrations, and shard rebalancing strategies for optimal cluster performance.

### Security and Access Control:
- **Authentication:** Secure MongoDB deployments with authentication mechanisms such as SCRAM-SHA-256 (Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism) for authenticating client connections and preventing unauthorized access.
- **Authorization:** Configure role-based access control (RBAC) in MongoDB for granting privileges and permissions to users and applications based on roles, permissions, and access levels.
- **Encryption:** Enable encryption at rest and encryption in transit in MongoDB deployments using WiredTiger encryption, TLS/SSL encryption, and client-side field-level encryption for data protection and confidentiality.

### Backup and Disaster Recovery:
- **Backup Strategies:** Implement backup and disaster recovery strategies for MongoDB deployments using MongoDB Atlas Backup, filesystem snapshots, or third-party backup solutions for data protection and disaster resilience.
- **Point-in-Time Recovery:** Perform point-in-time recovery (PITR) in MongoDB using oplog-based replay or snapshot-based restore techniques to restore databases to specific points in time for data consistency and recovery.

### Monitoring and Performance Tuning:
- **Monitoring Tools:** Monitor MongoDB deployments using built-in monitoring tools like MongoDB Atlas Monitoring, MongoDB Cloud Manager, or third-party monitoring solutions for tracking performance metrics, resource utilization, and cluster health.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize MongoDB performance using profiling tools, query optimization techniques, index tuning, and schema design best practices for improving query execution times and resource efficiency.
- **Connection Pooling:** Configure connection pooling settings in MongoDB drivers and applications for managing database connections, connection pooling, and connection lifecycle management to minimize connection overhead and improve scalability.

### Deployment and Operations:
- **Deployment Options:** Deploy MongoDB in various environments including on-premises, cloud, or hybrid deployments using MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB Enterprise Server, or community editions for flexible deployment options and operational flexibility.
- **Configuration Management:** Manage MongoDB deployment configurations, settings, and parameters using configuration files, environment variables, or orchestration tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automating deployment and configuration management tasks.
- **Health Checks:** Implement health checks, monitoring probes, and alerting mechanisms in MongoDB deployments using tools like MongoDB Cloud Manager, Prometheus, or Nagios for proactive monitoring, alerting, and incident response.

### Backup and Restore:
- **Backup Strategies:** Implement backup and disaster recovery strategies for MongoDB deployments using MongoDB Atlas Backup, filesystem snapshots, or third-party backup solutions for data protection and disaster resilience.
- **Point-in-Time Recovery:** Perform point-in-time recovery (PITR) in MongoDB using oplog-based replay or snapshot-based restore techniques to restore databases to specific points in time for data consistency and recovery.
