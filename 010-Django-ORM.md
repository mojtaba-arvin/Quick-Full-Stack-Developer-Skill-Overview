### Django ORM Basics:
- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):** Understand the fundamentals of Django ORM as a high-level abstraction layer for interacting with relational databases.
- **Model:** Define database models using Django ORM's Model class for representing database tables, fields, relationships, and constraints.
- **QuerySet:** Use QuerySet API for executing SQL queries and retrieving, filtering, sorting, and aggregating data from database tables.
- **Manager:** Customize database query behavior and extend QuerySet functionality using custom model managers for encapsulating query logic and reusability.
- **Field Types:** Explore Django ORM's built-in field types (e.g., CharField, IntegerField, ForeignKey) for defining database columns and data types.
- **Migrations:** Manage database schema changes and versioning using Django's migration framework for creating, applying, and rolling back database migrations.

### Model Definition:
- **Model Fields:** Define database fields using Django model field types (e.g., CharField, IntegerField, ForeignKey, ManyToManyField) with options for specifying data types, constraints, and relationships.
- **Model Relationships:** Establish relationships between Django models using ForeignKey, OneToOneField, ManyToManyField, and GenericForeignKey for representing one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many associations.
- **Model Inheritance:** Use model inheritance techniques (e.g., abstract base classes, multi-table inheritance, proxy models) to create hierarchical relationships and share common fields and behavior among models.
- **Meta Options:** Customize model metadata and behavior using Django Meta class options (e.g., ordering, indexes, constraints, verbose names) for controlling database table creation and query behavior.

### Querying and Filtering:
- **QuerySet API:** Use Django QuerySet API for executing database queries with methods like filter(), exclude(), order_by(), distinct(), annotate(), aggregate(), and values() for data retrieval and manipulation.
- **Query Expressions:** Construct complex database queries using Django ORM's query expressions (e.g., F expressions, Q objects, conditional expressions) for dynamic filtering, conditional logic, and database function evaluation.
- **Lookup Types:** Apply lookup types (e.g., exact, contains, icontains, gt, lt) in Django ORM queries for specifying comparison criteria, text search, and range queries on model fields.
- **Related Object Queries:** Traverse relationships and perform queries across related objects using double underscore notation (e.g., 'related_model__field') for joining, filtering, and accessing related model data.

### Aggregation and Annotation:
- **Aggregation:** Perform database aggregations using Django ORM's aggregation functions (e.g., Count, Sum, Avg, Min, Max) for calculating aggregate values and summary statistics on query result sets.
- **Annotation:** Add custom computed fields to query result sets using Django ORM's annotation feature for generating derived values, aggregations, or complex expressions as query output.

### Transactions and Atomicity:
- **Transaction Management:** Wrap database operations in transactions using Django ORM's atomic() decorator or context manager for ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties) of database transactions.
- **Savepoints:** Use savepoints in Django ORM transactions for nested transaction management and partial rollback of database changes within a larger transaction context.

### Performance Optimization:
- **Query Optimization:** Optimize Django ORM queries using select_related(), prefetch_related(), only(), defer(), and values() query optimizations for reducing database round-trips, minimizing query execution time, and optimizing memory usage.
- **Database Indexing:** Improve query performance by adding database indexes (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys, unique indexes, composite indexes) to model fields for faster data retrieval and efficient query execution.
- **Caching:** Cache query results, database objects, and computed values using Django caching mechanisms (e.g., cache_page, cache_control, cache middleware) for reducing database load and improving application performance.

### Serialization and Deserialization:
- **Serialization:** Serialize Django model instances to native Python data structures (e.g., JSON, XML, YAML) using Django serializers (e.g., serializers.serialize(), JSONField) for data interchange and storage.
- **Deserialization:** Deserialize native data structures back into Django model instances using Django deserialization functions (e.g., serializers.deserialize(), Model.save()) for restoring object state from serialized data.

### Database Transactions and Locking:
- **Transaction Isolation Levels:** Understand different transaction isolation levels (e.g., READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, SERIALIZABLE) supported by the underlying database engine and their impact on data consistency, concurrency, and transaction behavior.
- **Database Locking:** Use Django ORM's select_for_update() and select_related(..., for_update=True) query options for acquiring row-level locks and preventing concurrent access and modification of database records by multiple transactions.

### Raw SQL Queries and Expressions:
- **Raw SQL Queries:** Execute raw SQL queries using Django ORM's raw() method or RawSQL expressions for performing database operations beyond the scope of Django's ORM abstraction layer.
- **Raw SQL Expressions:** Construct raw SQL expressions and database functions using Django's Func expressions, RawSQL expressions, and F expressions for evaluating database-side logic, functions, and expressions.

### Database Transactions and Locking:
- **Transaction Isolation Levels:** Understand different transaction isolation levels (e.g., READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, SERIALIZABLE) supported by the underlying database engine and their impact on data consistency, concurrency, and transaction behavior.
- **Database Locking:** Use Django ORM's select_for_update() and select_related(..., for_update=True) query options for acquiring row-level locks and preventing concurrent access and modification of database records by multiple transactions.

### Signals and Hooks:
- **Model Signals:** Define and handle model signals (e.g., pre_save, post_save, pre_delete, post_delete) using Django's signals framework for triggering custom logic and actions before or after database operations.
- **Queryset Signals:** Implement queryset signals and hooks using Django QuerySet events (e.g., pre_init, post_init, pre_save, post_save, pre_delete, post_delete) for intercepting and modifying queryset behavior and query execution.

### Integration with Flask and Other Frameworks:
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy:** Integrate Django ORM with Flask applications using Flask-SQLAlchemy extension for seamless database integration, query execution, and session management.
- **Django ORM Outside Django:** Use Django ORM outside of Django projects by configuring and initializing Django settings, database connections, and ORM components for standalone applications or integration with other Python frameworks.

### Testing and Mocking:
- **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for Django models, queries, and transactions using testing frameworks like pytest, unittest, or Django's built-in testing tools for validating database interactions, data integrity, and business logic.
- **Mocking:** Mock Django ORM objects, methods, and database interactions using testing libraries like unittest.mock or MagicMock for isolated testing and dependency injection.
