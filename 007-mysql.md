### MySQL Basics:
- **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS):** Understand the fundamentals of MySQL as a popular open-source relational database.
- **Data Types:** Learn about MySQL data types including integer, numeric, text, character, date/time, boolean, JSON, and custom types.
- **SQL Syntax:** Master SQL commands and syntax for data manipulation (DML), data definition (DDL), data control (DCL), and transaction control (TCL).
- **Tables:** Create and manage database tables, including creating, altering, and dropping tables, and defining constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes.
- **Indexes:** Improve query performance by creating and maintaining indexes on database tables for efficient data retrieval and sorting.
- **Transactions:** Ensure data consistency and integrity with ACID-compliant transactions, including commit, rollback, and savepoint operations.

### Data Modeling and Design:
- **Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling:** Design database schemas and relationships using ER diagrams to visualize entity types, attributes, and associations.
- **Normalization:** Normalize database schemas to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity by eliminating insertion, update, and deletion anomalies.
- **Denormalization:** Optimize query performance by selectively denormalizing database schemas to reduce join operations and improve data retrieval speed.
- **Table Partitioning:** Partition large tables into smaller manageable chunks based on specific criteria such as range, list, or hash partitioning for improved performance and manageability.
- **Foreign Keys and Constraints:** Establish relationships between tables using foreign key constraints to enforce referential integrity and maintain data consistency.

### Querying and Optimization:
- **SELECT Statements:** Write efficient SELECT queries with filtering, sorting, joining, grouping, and aggregation operations to retrieve data from MySQL tables.
- **Query Optimization:** Optimize SQL queries using query execution plans, indexing strategies, query hints, and performance tuning techniques such as EXPLAIN.
- **Stored Procedures and Functions:** Create user-defined functions (UDFs), stored procedures, and triggers in MySQL using SQL or procedural languages like SQL/PSM for custom business logic and automation.
- **Full-Text Search:** Implement full-text search capabilities in MySQL using built-in features like full-text indexes, match against syntax, and natural language search for advanced search functionality.
- **Window Functions:** Use window functions in MySQL to perform calculations and analytics over ordered sets of rows for advanced data analysis and reporting.

### High Availability and Replication:
- **Replication:** Set up and configure replication in MySQL for creating master-slave or master-master replication topologies for high availability and disaster recovery.
- **Failover and Switchover:** Implement failover and switchover procedures in MySQL clusters using tools like MySQL Replication Manager (mysqlrpladmin) or third-party solutions for automated failover and recovery.
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute read and write workloads across multiple MySQL replicas using load balancing techniques such as connection pooling, read replicas, and proxy servers like HAProxy or MaxScale for scalability and performance.

### Security and Access Control:
- **Authentication Methods:** Secure MySQL databases with various authentication methods including password authentication, certificate-based authentication, LDAP authentication, and native authentication plugins for user authentication and access control.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement role-based access control in MySQL using user accounts, roles, privileges, and access control lists (ACLs) to manage user permissions and database security.
- **SSL/TLS Encryption:** Enable SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication between MySQL clients and servers to protect data privacy and prevent eavesdropping and tampering.
- **Auditing and Logging:** Monitor database activity, audit trails, and security events in MySQL using logging, auditing, and monitoring tools for compliance, security, and forensic analysis.

### Backup and Recovery:
- **Backup Strategies:** Implement backup strategies for MySQL databases including full backups, incremental backups, and point-in-time recovery (PITR) for data protection and disaster recovery.
- **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR):** Perform point-in-time recovery in MySQL using binary log files (binlogs) and incremental backups to restore databases to specific points in time for data consistency and integrity.
- **Backup Automation:** Automate backup and recovery tasks using MySQL utilities such as mysqldump, mysqlbackup, or third-party backup solutions for scheduled backups, retention policies, and recovery testing.

### Monitoring and Performance Tuning:
- **Monitoring Tools:** Monitor MySQL database performance, resource utilization, and query execution using built-in monitoring tools like Performance Schema, Information Schema, and MySQL Enterprise Monitor.
- **Performance Tuning:** Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks in MySQL databases using performance tuning techniques such as query optimization, indexing, buffer pool tuning, and configuration tuning for improved throughput and response times.
- **Connection Pooling:** Improve database scalability and performance by implementing connection pooling solutions like MySQL Router, MySQL Proxy, or third-party proxies to manage database connections and reduce overhead.

### Database Administration:
- **Database Maintenance:** Perform routine database maintenance tasks such as vacuuming, analyzing, optimizing, and repairing tables to optimize database performance and reclaim storage space.
- **Schema Management:** Manage database schemas, objects, and dependencies using SQL commands, schema migration tools (e.g., mysqldump, mysqldiff), and version control systems for schema evolution and change management.
- **Data Import and Export:** Import and export data to and from MySQL databases using utilities like mysqldump, mysqlimport, and LOAD DATA INFILE for data migration, backup, and integration.
- **Database Upgrades:** Plan and execute MySQL database upgrades, version migrations, and patch management activities using upgrade guides, release notes, and testing procedures for compatibility and data integrity.

### Disaster Recovery Planning:
- **Backup and Restore Procedures:** Document backup and restore procedures, recovery workflows, and disaster recovery plans for MySQL databases to ensure business continuity and data resilience.
- **High Availability Architectures:** Design and implement high availability architectures, failover mechanisms, and recovery strategies for MySQL databases to minimize downtime and data loss in case of failures or disasters.
- **Backup Testing:** Regularly test backup and recovery procedures, perform recovery drills, and validate backup integrity to verify data recoverability and reliability in real-world scenarios.
