### Kubernetes Basics:
- **Container Orchestration:** Understand the fundamentals of Kubernetes as an open-source container orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Clusters:** Set up and manage Kubernetes clusters consisting of multiple nodes (e.g., VMs, bare-metal servers, cloud instances) for running containerized workloads across distributed environments.
- **Pods:** Deploy and manage pods, which are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, encapsulating one or more containers, shared storage, and configuration data.
- **Deployments:** Define deployment resources in Kubernetes to manage application deployments, replica sets, scaling, and rolling updates for ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

### Services and Networking:
- **Services:** Create Kubernetes services to expose pods and provide stable, load-balanced access to containerized applications within the cluster or to external clients using service discovery and DNS resolution.
- **Ingress:** Configure Kubernetes Ingress resources to expose HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services and applications running inside the cluster for external access and traffic routing.
- **Networking:** Understand Kubernetes networking concepts, including pod networking, container networking interfaces (CNIs), network policies, and service mesh integration for secure, scalable communication between pods and services.

### Storage and Volumes:
- **Volumes:** Attach and mount persistent volumes (PVs) or cloud storage volumes (e.g., AWS EBS, Azure Disk, GCP Persistent Disk) to Kubernetes pods for storing application data, logs, and configuration files.
- **Persistent Volume Claims:** Define persistent volume claims (PVCs) in Kubernetes to request and dynamically provision storage resources from storage classes, volume plugins, or external storage providers based on storage requirements and access modes.

### Configuration and Secrets:
- **ConfigMaps:** Create Kubernetes ConfigMap objects to store configuration data, environment variables, and application settings as key-value pairs or configuration files for decoupling configuration from application code.
- **Secrets:** Manage sensitive data and credentials in Kubernetes secrets for securely storing and distributing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API tokens, TLS certificates) to pods and containers without exposing plaintext data.

### Deployments and Rollouts:
- **Deployments:** Define Kubernetes deployment resources to manage application deployments, updates, and rollbacks by specifying desired pod replicas, container images, health checks, and deployment strategies (e.g., rolling updates, blue-green deployments).
- **Rolling Updates:** Perform rolling updates of Kubernetes deployments by gradually replacing old pod replicas with new ones, monitoring deployment progress, and ensuring zero-downtime application updates and continuous availability.

### Autoscaling and Resource Management:
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):** Configure Kubernetes HPAs to automatically scale the number of pod replicas based on CPU utilization, memory consumption, or custom metrics for optimizing resource utilization and performance.
- **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA):** Use Kubernetes VPAs to dynamically adjust pod resource requests and limits based on workload characteristics, resource usage patterns, and performance requirements for efficient resource allocation and management.

### Observability and Monitoring:
- **Metrics Collection:** Collect and export Kubernetes metrics, resource usage data, and cluster health metrics to monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog, Grafana) for real-time monitoring, alerting, and performance analysis.
- **Logging:** Centralize logging from Kubernetes clusters and containerized applications using logging agents, log collectors, and log forwarding mechanisms (e.g., Fluentd, Fluent Bit, Logstash) for log aggregation, analysis, and troubleshooting.

### Security and Access Control:
- **RBAC:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes to define fine-grained access policies, roles, and permissions for controlling access to cluster resources, API operations, and sensitive data.
- **Network Policies:** Define Kubernetes network policies to enforce network segmentation, traffic isolation, and firewall rules for restricting communication between pods, services, and external endpoints based on label selectors and IP address ranges.

### High Availability and Disaster Recovery:
- **Fault Tolerance:** Ensure high availability and fault tolerance in Kubernetes clusters by deploying redundant pods, replicas, and services across multiple availability zones, regions, or cloud providers for resilient application architectures.
- **Backup and Restore:** Implement backup and disaster recovery strategies for Kubernetes clusters and persistent data using tools like Velero, Heptio Ark, or custom backup solutions for data protection and business continuity.

### CI/CD Integration:
- **GitOps:** Adopt GitOps practices and methodologies for managing Kubernetes configurations, deployments, and infrastructure as code (IaC) using Git repositories, version control, and automated workflows for continuous integration and delivery.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Build and automate CI/CD pipelines for Kubernetes deployments using CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI) for code integration, testing, building container images, and deploying applications to Kubernetes clusters.

### Custom Resources and Operators:
- **Custom Resources:** Define custom resource definitions (CRDs) in Kubernetes to extend the Kubernetes API and create custom resources, controllers, and operators for managing complex, application-specific workloads and resources.
- **Operators:** Develop Kubernetes operators to automate application lifecycle management, operational tasks, and day-2 operations (e.g., scaling, backup, recovery) using custom controllers, event-driven workflows, and declarative configuration.

### Multi-Cluster Management:
- **Federation:** Federate multiple Kubernetes clusters using Kubernetes Federation v2 or similar tools for centralized management, policy enforcement, and workload distribution across geographically distributed clusters and environments.
- **Cluster API:** Use the Kubernetes Cluster API (CAPI) project to provision, manage, and operate Kubernetes clusters as declarative, Kubernetes-native resources using custom controllers, operators, and infrastructure providers.
