### OAuth 2.0 Protocol Basics:
- **Authorization Framework:** Understand OAuth 2.0 as an authorization framework for delegated access to protected resources on the web, allowing applications to obtain limited access tokens on behalf of users.
- **Roles:** Identify the roles involved in OAuth 2.0 transactions, including the resource owner, client application, authorization server, and resource server.
- **Tokens:** Differentiate between access tokens, refresh tokens, and authorization codes used in OAuth 2.0 flows for authentication and authorization purposes.

### OAuth 2.0 Flows:
- **Authorization Code Flow:** Implement the authorization code flow in OAuth 2.0 for web applications, which involves exchanging an authorization code for an access token via the authorization server.
- **Implicit Flow:** Implement the implicit flow in OAuth 2.0 for client-side applications (e.g., single-page apps), where access tokens are returned directly in the URL fragment after user authentication.
- **Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow:** Implement the resource owner password credentials flow for trusted applications, where users provide their credentials directly to the client application for token issuance.
- **Client Credentials Flow:** Implement the client credentials flow for machine-to-machine communication, where the client application authenticates directly with the authorization server to obtain access tokens.
- **Refresh Token Flow:** Implement the refresh token flow in OAuth 2.0 for obtaining new access tokens using refresh tokens without requiring user reauthentication.

### Scopes and Permissions:
- **Scopes:** Define and enforce scopes in OAuth 2.0 to specify the permissions and access levels granted to client applications when requesting access tokens from the authorization server.
- **Scope Granularity:** Define fine-grained scopes with specific permissions (e.g., read, write, delete) to control access to protected resources based on user consent and application requirements.

### Authorization Server:
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Configure the authorization server to handle authentication, user consent, and authorization decisions for granting access tokens to client applications.
- **Token Management:** Manage access tokens, refresh tokens, and authorization codes issued by the authorization server, including token issuance, validation, expiration, and revocation.
- **Token Introspection:** Implement token introspection endpoints to allow resource servers to validate access tokens and retrieve metadata about token validity and associated scopes.

### Security Best Practices:
- **Token Security:** Ensure secure storage, transmission, and handling of access tokens, refresh tokens, and authorization codes to prevent token leakage, interception, and misuse.
- **Token Expiration:** Set appropriate token expiration times and refresh token policies to mitigate token leakage and unauthorized access risks.
- **Token Revocation:** Implement mechanisms for token revocation and invalidation to revoke access tokens and refresh tokens in case of security incidents, user revocation, or session termination.

### Token Exchange:
- **Token Exchange Protocol:** Implement the OAuth 2.0 token exchange protocol to enable secure token delegation and exchange between different entities (e.g., clients, services, users) within trusted environments.
- **Delegated Authorization:** Delegate access rights and permissions between entities using token exchange mechanisms for cross-service authentication, authorization, and trust propagation.

### OAuth 2.0 Extensions:
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC):** Extend OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect for identity layer functionality, including authentication, user info retrieval, ID token issuance, and session management.
- **Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE):** Enhance OAuth 2.0 security with PKCE for public clients (e.g., native apps, single-page apps) to prevent authorization code interception attacks and code replay attacks.
- **Token Binding:** Implement token binding mechanisms to bind access tokens to client certificates or hardware tokens for enhanced security and protection against token theft and misuse.
