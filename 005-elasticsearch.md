### Elasticsearch Basics:
- **Indexing:** Understand the concept of indexing in Elasticsearch, including data storage, mappings, and indexing strategies.
- **Searching:** Perform basic and advanced searches in Elasticsearch using query DSL, filters, aggregations, and search APIs.
- **Documents:** Manage document data in Elasticsearch, including CRUD operations, document structure, and data types.
- **Mappings:** Define mappings for Elasticsearch indexes to specify field data types, analyzers, and index settings.
- **Index Management:** Manage indexes in Elasticsearch, including creation, deletion, and configuration of index settings.
- **Cluster Architecture:** Understand Elasticsearch cluster architecture, including nodes, shards, replicas, and cluster coordination.

### Querying and Filtering:
- **Query DSL:** Construct complex queries in Elasticsearch using the Query DSL (Domain Specific Language) for full-text search, term queries, range queries, and more.
- **Filters:** Apply filters to search results in Elasticsearch to narrow down results based on specific criteria without affecting relevance scoring.
- **Aggregations:** Perform analytics and statistical operations on search results in Elasticsearch using aggregations for metrics, bucketing, and pipeline aggregations.

### Data Modeling:
- **Mapping Types:** Define mapping types in Elasticsearch to specify the structure and data types of documents within an index.
- **Dynamic Mapping:** Configure dynamic mapping in Elasticsearch to automatically detect and define field mappings based on document data.
- **Nested Documents:** Model nested and hierarchical data structures in Elasticsearch using nested documents for complex data relationships.

### Indexing and Retrieval:
- **Indexing Documents:** Index documents in Elasticsearch using index APIs to store and retrieve data for searching and analysis.
- **Bulk Indexing:** Perform bulk indexing of documents in Elasticsearch for efficient data loading and indexing operations.
- **Document Retrieval:** Retrieve documents from Elasticsearch indexes using document IDs, queries, and filters for real-time data access.

### Aggregations and Analytics:
- **Metrics Aggregations:** Compute metrics and statistics on search results in Elasticsearch using metrics aggregations for calculations like sums, averages, and counts.
- **Bucketing Aggregations:** Group search results into buckets based on specific criteria using bucketing aggregations for terms, ranges, dates, and geolocation.
- **Pipeline Aggregations:** Perform multi-stage aggregations and computations in Elasticsearch using pipeline aggregations for advanced analytics and metrics.

### Analysis and Tokenization:
- **Analyzers:** Define custom analyzers in Elasticsearch to specify how text data is processed, tokenized, and indexed for full-text search.
- **Tokenization:** Understand the tokenization process in Elasticsearch, including tokenizers, token filters, and character filters for text analysis.
- **Language Analyzers:** Use built-in and custom language analyzers in Elasticsearch to support different languages and text processing requirements.

### Index Management:
- **Index Settings:** Configure index settings in Elasticsearch to optimize performance, control memory usage, and manage disk space.
- **Index Aliases:** Create aliases for Elasticsearch indexes to provide alternative names and aliases for accessing index data.
- **Index Templates:** Define index templates in Elasticsearch to apply default settings and mappings for new indexes that match specific patterns.

### Cluster Management:
- **Node Configuration:** Configure Elasticsearch nodes for performance optimization, resource allocation, and fault tolerance in cluster environments.
- **Shard Allocation:** Manage shard allocation and rebalancing in Elasticsearch clusters for data distribution and fault tolerance.
- **Cluster Monitoring:** Monitor Elasticsearch clusters using built-in monitoring features, REST APIs, and third-party monitoring tools for performance analysis and troubleshooting.

### Scaling and High Availability:
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Scale Elasticsearch clusters horizontally by adding more nodes and distributing data across multiple nodes for increased capacity and performance.
- **Replication:** Configure index replication in Elasticsearch to create replica shards for high availability and data redundancy.
- **Failover and Recovery:** Implement failover and recovery strategies in Elasticsearch clusters to ensure continuous availability and data integrity in case of node failures.

### Security and Access Control:
- **Authentication:** Secure Elasticsearch clusters using authentication mechanisms like basic authentication, LDAP, Active Directory, or SAML for user authentication and access control.
- **Authorization:** Control access to Elasticsearch resources and APIs using role-based access control (RBAC), privileges, and access control lists (ACLs) for data security and compliance.
- **Transport Layer Security (TLS):** Enable TLS encryption and certificate-based authentication for secure communication between Elasticsearch nodes and clients over the network.

### Monitoring and Performance Tuning:
- **Cluster Health Monitoring:** Monitor Elasticsearch cluster health, node status, and index performance using built-in monitoring APIs, cluster health indicators, and third-party monitoring tools.
- **Performance Tuning:** Optimize Elasticsearch cluster performance using performance tuning techniques like JVM heap size tuning, thread pool management, and query optimization for efficient resource utilization and query execution.
- **Query Profiling:** Profile and analyze Elasticsearch queries using query profiling tools, explain API, and search profiling to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize query performance.

### Backup and Disaster Recovery:
- **Snapshot and Restore:** Create and manage snapshots of Elasticsearch indexes for backup and disaster recovery using snapshot APIs and repository configurations.
- **Incremental Backups:** Perform incremental backups of Elasticsearch indexes to minimize data loss and recovery time in case of failures or disasters.
- **Disaster Recovery Planning:** Develop disaster recovery plans and strategies for Elasticsearch clusters, including backup schedules, off-site backups, and data retention policies for business continuity and data protection.
