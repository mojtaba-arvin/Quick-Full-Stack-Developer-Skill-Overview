### Regular Expressions Basics:
- **Pattern Matching:** Use regular expressions (regex) to define search patterns for matching text strings, characters, and patterns within input data.
- **Metacharacters:** Utilize metacharacters (e.g., ., *, +, ?, ^, $, [], (), {}) to represent specific characters, character classes, quantifiers, anchors, and modifiers in regex patterns.
- **Literal Characters:** Match literal characters and strings in regex patterns to find exact matches of specific text or substrings within input data.
- **Character Classes:** Define character classes (e.g., \d, \w, \s, \D, \W, \S) to represent sets of characters or character ranges in regex patterns for matching alphanumeric characters, digits, whitespace, and special characters.
- **Anchors:** Use anchors (e.g., ^, $, \b, \B) to specify the position of text matches relative to the beginning or end of a line, word, or input string in regex patterns.

### Quantifiers and Alternation:
- **Quantifiers:** Apply quantifiers (e.g., *, +, ?, {n}, {n,}, {n,m}) to specify the number of occurrences or repetitions of characters, character classes, or groups in regex patterns for matching variable-length sequences.
- **Greedy vs. Lazy Matching:** Understand the difference between greedy and lazy quantifiers in regex patterns, where greedy quantifiers match as much text as possible, while lazy quantifiers match as little text as necessary.
- **Alternation:** Use alternation (|) to define multiple alternative patterns or choices within regex patterns, matching any of the specified alternatives in input data.

### Groups and Capture:
- **Grouping:** Group parts of regex patterns using parentheses (()) to create subpatterns, apply quantifiers, or define logical groupings for matching complex patterns or extracting substrings.
- **Capture Groups:** Capture matched substrings or portions of input data using capture groups in regex patterns, enabling extraction and manipulation of specific parts of text matches for further processing.
- **Named Groups:** Assign names to capture groups in regex patterns using named capture groups (e.g., (?P<name>pattern)) to label and identify captured substrings by name in regex matches.

### Character Escapes and Escaped Sequences:
- **Escaped Characters:** Escape special characters and metacharacters in regex patterns using backslashes (\) to match literal instances of reserved characters in input data (e.g., \., \*, \?, \^).
- **Escaped Sequences:** Use escaped sequences (e.g., \t, \n, \r, \xHH, \uHHHH, \UHHHHHHHH) to represent non-printable characters, control characters, hexadecimal characters, or Unicode code points in regex patterns for matching specific character sequences.

### Lookahead and Lookbehind:
- **Positive Lookahead:** Use positive lookahead assertions (?=pattern) to assert that a specific pattern or substring follows the current position in input data, without consuming the matched text.
- **Negative Lookahead:** Apply negative lookahead assertions (?!pattern) to assert that a specific pattern or substring does not follow the current position in input data, preventing matches when the specified pattern is present.
- **Positive Lookbehind:** Utilize positive lookbehind assertions (?<=pattern) to assert that a specific pattern or substring precedes the current position in input data, without consuming the matched text.
- **Negative Lookbehind:** Implement negative lookbehind assertions (?<!pattern) to assert that a specific pattern or substring does not precede the current position in input data, excluding matches when the specified pattern is present.

### Flags and Modifiers:
- **Regex Flags:** Apply flags or modifiers (e.g., i, m, s, x) to regex patterns to modify matching behavior, case sensitivity, multiline matching, and whitespace handling in regex matches.
- **Case Insensitivity:** Enable case-insensitive matching in regex patterns using the "i" flag or modifier to match text regardless of letter case (e.g., A matches a, a, or A).
- **Multiline Matching:** Enable multiline mode in regex patterns using the "m" flag or modifier to match the beginning (^) and end ($) of lines within multiline input data.
- **Dot-All Mode:** Enable dot-all mode in regex patterns using the "s" flag or modifier to allow the dot (.) metacharacter to match any character, including newline characters (\n).
- **Verbose Mode:** Enable verbose mode in regex patterns using the "x" flag or modifier to ignore whitespace and comments in regex patterns, improving pattern readability and maintainability.

### Regex Libraries and Tools:
- **Regex Libraries:** Utilize regex libraries and modules available in programming languages (e.g., re module in Python, java.util.regex package in Java, regex package in Go) to perform regex pattern matching, search, substitution, and validation operations.
- **Online Regex Testers:** Use online regex
