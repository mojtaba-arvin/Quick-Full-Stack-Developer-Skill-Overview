### Amazon EC2 Basics:
- **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2):** Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to launch virtual servers, known as instances, and scale compute resources up or down based on demand.
- **Instance Types:** Amazon EC2 offers a wide range of instance types optimized for different workloads, including general-purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, storage-optimized, and GPU instances.
- **AMI (Amazon Machine Image):** An AMI is a preconfigured template that contains the software configuration (OS, applications, libraries) required to launch an EC2 instance. Users can choose from existing AMIs or create custom ones.

### Instance Management:
- **Instance Launch:** Launch EC2 instances using the AWS Management Console, CLI (Command Line Interface), SDKs (Software Development Kits), or APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) with customizable configurations such as instance type, OS, storage, and networking.
- **Instance Lifecycle:** Manage the lifecycle of EC2 instances, including provisioning, starting, stopping, rebooting, terminating, and resizing instances based on workload requirements and cost optimization strategies.
- **Instance Metadata:** Access instance metadata and user data from within EC2 instances using instance metadata service (IMDS) and user data scripts for retrieving instance information, configuration details, and initialization tasks.

### Networking and Security:
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** Create VPCs to logically isolate and segment EC2 instances within customizable virtual networks, subnets, and route tables, and configure networking settings such as IP addressing, routing, and internet connectivity.
- **Security Groups:** Define security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances by specifying allowed protocols, ports, and IP address ranges, and apply security group rules at the instance level for network security.
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** Manage access to EC2 resources using IAM roles, policies, and permissions to grant granular permissions for managing instances, attaching volumes, and interacting with EC2 APIs.

### Storage and Snapshots:
- **EBS (Elastic Block Store):** Attach EBS volumes to EC2 instances as block-level storage for durable, high-performance storage, and use features such as snapshots, encryption, and volume resizing to manage data persistence and scalability.
- **Instance Store:** Utilize instance store volumes, also known as ephemeral storage, provided by EC2 instances for temporary data storage and scratch space, but note that instance store data is lost upon instance termination or stoppage.

### Scaling and Auto Scaling:
- **Auto Scaling Groups:** Create auto scaling groups to automatically scale EC2 capacity up or down based on demand, defined scaling policies, and health checks, and distribute instances across multiple availability zones for fault tolerance.
- **Scaling Policies:** Define scaling policies to dynamically adjust the number of EC2 instances in response to changes in workload metrics, such as CPU utilization, request rates, or custom metrics, to maintain performance and availability.

### Monitoring and Logging:
- **CloudWatch Metrics:** Monitor EC2 instance performance and health using CloudWatch metrics for CPU utilization, network traffic, disk I/O, and other system metrics, and set up alarms and notifications based on predefined thresholds.
- **CloudWatch Logs:** Collect and analyze log data from EC2 instances using CloudWatch Logs for troubleshooting, debugging, and auditing purposes, and create log groups, log streams, and retention policies for log management.

### Instance Connectivity:
- **SSH (Secure Shell):** Access Linux-based EC2 instances using SSH (Secure Shell) for remote administration, command-line access, and file transfer over encrypted connections, and configure SSH key pairs for authentication.
- **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol):** Connect to Windows-based EC2 instances using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) for remote desktop access, administration, and GUI-based interactions, and configure Windows user accounts and passwords.

### Cost Management:
- **On-Demand Instances:** Pay for EC2 instances on an hourly or per-second basis with no long-term commitments or upfront payments, and scale compute resources up or down based on demand to optimize cost and resource utilization.
- **Reserved Instances:** Reserve EC2 capacity for a fixed term (1-3 years) and receive significant discounts compared to on-demand pricing, suitable for steady-state workloads with predictable usage patterns.
- **Spot Instances:** Bid on unused EC2 capacity (spot instances) and run workloads at a fraction of on-demand prices, ideal for fault-tolerant, time-flexible, or cost-sensitive applications, but subject to instance termination with short notice.

### Integration and Automation:
- **Integration with Other AWS Services:** Integrate EC2 instances with other AWS services such as S3, RDS, EFS, and Lambda to build scalable, distributed applications, and leverage AWS SDKs and APIs for programmatic access and automation.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Provision and manage EC2 instances using infrastructure as code (IaC) tools such as AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, or AWS CDK for declarative and automated infrastructure provisioning, configuration, and management.

### Backup and Disaster Recovery:
- **EBS Snapshots:** Create point-in-time snapshots of EBS volumes to back up data, preserve volume states, and restore volumes in case of data loss, corruption, or disaster recovery scenarios, and automate snapshot management using lifecycle policies.
- **Multi-AZ Deployments:** Deploy EC2 instances across multiple availability zones (AZs) within a region to achieve high availability, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery capabilities by leveraging redundant infrastructure and failover mechanisms.
